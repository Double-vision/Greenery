        <p>
            Gardening is the practice of growing and cultivating plants as part of horticulture. In gardens, ornamental
            plants are often grown for their flowers, foliage, or overall appearance; useful plants, such as root
            vegetables, leaf vegetables, fruits, and herbs, are grown for consumption, for use as dyes, or for medicinal
            or cosmetic use. Gardening is considered to be a relaxing activity for many people.

            Gardening ranges in scale from fruit orchards, to long boulevard plantings with one or more different types
            of shrubs, trees and herbaceous plants, to residential yards including lawns and foundation plantings, to
            plants in large or small containers grown inside or outside. Gardening may be very specialized, with only
            one type of plant grown, or involve a large number of different plants in mixed plantings. It involves an
            active participation in the growing of plants, and tends to be labor-intensive, which differentiates it from
            farming or forestry. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardening">(Wikipedia)</a>
