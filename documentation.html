        <h2>Font Scheme</h2>
        <p>
            For the fonts I wanted to go with a modern look and feel for the site. I found a very useful resource with
            Google fonts offering free well-designed fonts optimized for web-use. The main font used in teh site which is
            used from the navigation bar to headings and text is called Open Sans Condensed. This font is sans-serif and
            has a very modern appearance by being low-weight while also being very easy to read.

            For my Logo font I went with another design from Google fonts called Pacifico. This font was chosen as
            it has a very weighty look to it that compliments the overall style of the site. Pacifico was also very well
            suited as a design font to be used for a logo.

        <h2>Colour Scheme</h2>
        <p>
            The Greenery implements a mostly monochrome colour scheme when it comes to the text and backgrounds for the text.
            I chose to keep things monochrome as i had chosen to implement a background image on the site that included many colours
            such as red, purple, orange, brown and white. The monochrome balanced-out the business of the background colours which
            meant the site took on a more natural look and feel. The colours in the monochrome scheme were Green and White which
            fit in with the theme of gardening.

        <h2>Lines and Borders Scheme</h2>
        <p>
            White space is used as often as possible on The Greenery to give it a very minimalistic and modern feel. The navigation
            bar is stretched the full width of the window to also give the site a modern look, omitting any borders around the edges of the page
            and instead having a static background. Articles and information is centered down the middle of the page with significant white space
            on either side while text is still left-aligned. This brings focus to the content of the site while also making it easy to read.

            The background is an image of a garden patio that has been blurred with a gaussian filter. By adding a blur to the background image,
            focus is able to be brought to the foreground where the main content is.

        <h2>Assumptions</h2>
        <p>
            Due to time limitations I was not able to implement the Gardening portion of the site, this was going to include features on
            tools, types of pots etc. Given more time I would also have sub-menus for some of the main pages of the site for users
            wanting to find information quicker. Another feature that I would like to have implemented was having a basket where
            users can place items for reference. For the site I focused on the design and making it look modern while also keeping
            all functions working correctly. This was a difficult task as there was quite a lot of css work involved in the making
            of the site that may have limited what I wanted to do in terms of site functionality.
