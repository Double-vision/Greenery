            To test the site for usability I instructed the user to carry out the task of finding and identifying a plant that
            grows in winter. The user quickly navigated to the Plants page using the navigation bar but was not able to find the
            season filter for the types of plants. Instead what was found was that the user first tried looking for clues in the
            text for the plants and then clicking on the plant name until eventually they found the seasonal filter.
        </p>
        <p>
            To remedy the found flaw in the website I added text in capital letters and an h2 heading style SELECT FILTERS HERE:.
            This was done with capital letters to grab attention to the user so that would be the first thing they read and will
            be informed of the filters presence.
